RAiD is a persistent identifier for research projects, which links a project’s organisations, people, inputs and outputs, as well as providing other key information about a research project. It is governed by ISO 23527:2022 with the ARDC as the global Registration Authority and various regional Registration Agencies (currently the ARDC in Australia and New Zealand and SURF Netherlands in Europe). It features prominently in the Australian National PID Strategy. RAiDs reduce the administrative burden of research project management, facilitate reporting of research outputs and impacts, and make research more transparent by exposing a project’s make-up and how it changes over time. RAiD is now in production, both in Australia and overseas.
