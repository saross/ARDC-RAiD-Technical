The RAiD Metadata Schema is divided into 'Core', 'Extended', and 'Local' components. The full metadata schema is available at: \href{https://metadata.raid.org/}{https://metadata.raid.org/}, and controlled vocabularies have been published via Research Vocabularies Australia \href{https://vocabulary.raid.org}{https://vocabularies.raid.org}.

\textbf{Core components} are metadata properties and associated controlled lists that are standardised across all RAiD Registration Agencies. If a Registration Agency uses its own controlled lists, it must provide a crosswalk to the RAiDâ€™s standard terms.

\textbf{Extended components} are properties that are standardised across all Registration Agencies, but associated controlled lists may vary. A Registration Agency may use its own controlled lists if it publishes each list in a machine-readable format and registers the controlled list(s) with the ARDC. 

\textbf{Local components} are properties and controlled lists that are entirely under the control of a Registration Agency, and only need to be reported to the ARDC. Local properties can be tailored to meet the needs of the research community served by the Registration Agency. 

A mechanism exists to promote Local metadata properties to Extended metadata, or Extended to Core.
